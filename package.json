  "description": "In order to submit bugs to Unity we request a project that reproduces the problem is included with the bug report. Often, creating a small cutdown project that shows the issue can take a lot of work. This tool is meant to simplify that process by quickly creating a new project that contains a small subset of the assets in your full project."
